# Hoon Assist

An [Atom](https://atom.io/) package assisting with the steep learning curve of the [Hoon](http://urbit.org/docs/hoon/) programming language.

Displays documentation for different Hoon terms that are under your cursor:

The documentation was extracted from the [docs repo](https://github.com/urbit/docs). Currently only the keywords and runes are mapped, I hope to add the standard library functions as well.
